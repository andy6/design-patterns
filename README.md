Examples of usage Design Patterns.

1. Creation patterns

   1. Composite pattern
      * It defines class hierarchies that contain primitive and complex objects.
      * There is a simple example of directory structure.
      
   1. Proxy pattern
      * It allows creating objects only if it is required. 
      * There is a simple example of loading and rendering image.
